# LMFCA-Net
Official repository for LMFCA-Net: A Lightweight Model for Multi-Channel Speech Enhancement with Efficient Narrow-Band and Cross-Band Attention.

The training scripts for LMFCA-Net are adapted from [McNet: Fuse Multiple Cues for Multichannel Speech Enhancement](https://github.com/Audio-WestlakeU/McNet). We extend our gratitude to them for their valuable contributions.

This work has been accepted for presentation at ICASSP 2025. We will update the link to our paper once it is available.
